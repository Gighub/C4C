Counseling for Choice (C4C) is an algorithm used for virtual assistant implementations (aka ‘chatbot’) that guides a user through a digital contraceptive counseling session so a short list of family planning methods can be recommended.

This workspace contains the three main json files that can be updated by the contributors: algorithm, questions and exceptions. Learn the structure and how to update the files [here.](https://github.com/psi-mis/SRH-C4C/wiki/1.-C4C-Algorithm-Engine)
